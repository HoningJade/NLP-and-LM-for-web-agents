The objective is to find the product SKUs in the most recent cancelled orders of the customer who has the most cancellations in the history. \n\nTo achieve this, we need to navigate to the customer's orders page and filter the orders to show only cancelled orders. Then, we can find the most recent cancelled order and retrieve the product SKUs from that order.\n\nBased on the observation, the current page is the customer's edit page. To navigate to the orders page, we need to click on the 'Orders' link. \n\nIn summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [2221]```"}</pre></div><div class='parsed_action' style='background-color:yellow'><pre>click [2221] where [2221] is [2221] link 'Orders' focused: True</pre></div></div>
